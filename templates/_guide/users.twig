        <h2>User Account Activation and Passwords</h2>
        <p>To activate a new user&rsquo;s account, start on the Users tab. Click on the username of that user to go to their user edit page. On this page, you&rsquo;ll see a black gear button with options for that particular user.</p>
        <p>When a new user is added, their account status is set to &ldquo;Unverified&rdquo;. To change this, click on the gear and click the &ldquo;Send activation email&rdquo; option. The user will receive an activation email that will allow them to set their password and log in. Once the user has logged in for the first time, their status is then changed to &ldquo;Active&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>You may immediately activate a user account by clicking on the &ldquo;Activate account&rdquo; option.</p>
